* General Purposes
I just wanted to share my Emacs configuration since I feel now productive with it.
The main idea of using Emacs was to make my workflow as simple as possible, mainly by using the same tools for many different things. 
I am actually a PhD student so I use Emacs with different programming environment such as C/C++, Web Development (HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/JS), Matlab etc. and also writting reports, notes articles and handling my bibliography.
Most of the resources have been found in other users configuration, I have just used some hacks to fit my needs.
Here is a description of how I use Emacs in my everyday's life.
* Matlab
Matlab is one of the software that I used the most.
