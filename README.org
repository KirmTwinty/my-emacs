* General Purposes
I just wanted to share my Emacs configuration since I feel now productive with it.
The main idea of using Emacs was to make my workflow as simple as possible, mainly by using the same tools for many different things. 

I am actually a PhD student so I use Emacs with different programming environment such as C/C++, Web Development (HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/JS), Matlab etc. and also writting reports, notes articles and handling my bibliography.

Most of the resources have been found in other users configuration, I have just used some hacks to fit my needs.

Here is a description of how I use Emacs in my everyday's life.
* Matlab
Matlab is one of the software that I used the most. 
Therefore, I am using the Matlab Mode which works greatly. You can find the source of the code by following this link:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/matlab-emacs/ 

Even if I am using mtags to generate a TAGS file to get my function definitions automatically with Matlab (see https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsTags), I found useful to get a list of all functions through Ivy (see https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper). This is mainly related to the way I code in Matlab. When I implement a GUI, I regroup my functions definition under a group title (defined by "%%"). Therefore, I can simply read my code in Ivy like if I was using some code folding.

Here is the result of the function in the ivy window:
#+CAPTION: Ivy Matlab Code Folding
#+NAME:   fig:IvyMatlabCodeFolding

For the documentation, I am using Doxygen, adapted to Matlab. I provide some snippets for yasnippet in the matlab folder for Doxygen patterns that fit Matlab.


* LaTeX
I am using LaTeX with org-mode which is really convenient because it offers a simple configuration and multiple options to export the file.
However I needed to setup a little bit my configuration to get something working well.
I am using Ivy (see [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper]]) for every completion I need and yasnippet for getting some automation patterns when I write code (see https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet).

First, I open my org file on one buffer and on the next one I open my pdf file to get an instant preview of what I am writting.
To do so, I ask DocView to switch to auto-revert-mode so that every time my pdf changes, DocView reloads its content.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;
;; DocView Settings 
;;
(setq doc-view-continuous t) ;; Continuous scrolling
;; Refresh automatically (necessary for LATEX preview)
(add-hook 'doc-view-mode-hook 'auto-revert-mode)  
#+END_SRC

Finally, we add a hook for exporting the latex to pdf each time we save. This is actually done when I create my document template by adding the following code at the end of the document:
#+BEGIN_SRC
* COMMENT Local Variables
  # Local Variables:
  # eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'org-latex-export-to-pdf t t)
  # End:
#+END_SRC
